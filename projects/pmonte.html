<h1>Monte Carlo</h1>

Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of
computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to
obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness
to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are
often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful
when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte
Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes:
optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a
probability distribution. 
<br><br>
In physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are useful for
simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as
fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular
structures (see cellular Potts model, interacting particle systems,
McKean–Vlasov processes, kinetic models of gases). 
<br><br>
Other examples include modeling phenomena with significant uncertainty
in inputs such as the calculation of risk in business and, in
mathematics, evaluation of multidimensional definite integrals with
complicated boundary conditions. In application to systems engineering
problems (space, oil exploration, aircraft design, etc.), Monte
Carlo–based predictions of failure, cost overruns and schedule
overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative
"soft" methods.
<br><br>
In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem
having a probabilistic interpretation. By the law of large numbers,
integrals described by the expected value of some random variable can
be approximated by taking the empirical mean (a.k.a. the 'sample
mean') of independent samples of the variable. When the probability
distribution of the variable is parameterized, mathematicians often
use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. The central
idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a prescribed
stationary probability distribution. That is, in the limit, the
samples being generated by the MCMC method will be samples from the
desired (target) distribution. By the ergodic theorem, the
stationary distribution is approximated by the empirical measures of
the random states of the MCMC sampler. 
<br><br>
In other problems, the objective is generating draws from a sequence
of probability distributions satisfying a nonlinear evolution
equation. These flows of probability distributions can always be
interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov
process whose transition probabilities depend on the distributions of
the current random states (see McKean–Vlasov processes, nonlinear
filtering equation). In other instances we are given a flow of
probability distributions with an increasing level of sampling
complexity (path spaces models with an increasing time horizon,
Boltzmann–Gibbs measures associated with decreasing temperature
parameters, and many others). These models can also be seen as the
evolution of the law of the random states of a nonlinear Markov
chain. A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear
Markov processes is to sample multiple copies of the process,
replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the
random states by the sampled empirical measures. In contrast with
traditional Monte Carlo and MCMC methodologies, these mean-field
particle techniques rely on sequential interacting samples. The
terminology mean field reflects the fact that each of the samples
(a.k.a. particles, individuals, walkers, agents, creatures, or
phenotypes) interacts with the empirical measures of the process. When
the size of the system tends to infinity, these random empirical
measures converge to the deterministic distribution of the random
states of the nonlinear Markov chain, so that the statistical
interaction between particles vanishes. 
<br><br>
Despite its conceptual and algorithmic simplicity, the computational
cost associated with a Monte Carlo simulation can be staggeringly
high. In general the method requires many samples to get a good
approximation, which may incur an arbitrarily large total runtime if
the processing time of a single sample is high. Although this is a
severe limitation in very complex problems, the embarrassingly
parallel nature of the algorithm allows this large cost to be reduced
(perhaps to a feasible level) through parallel computing strategies in
local processors, clusters, cloud computing, GPU, FPGA,
etc.
