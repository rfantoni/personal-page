<h1>Polymers</h1>

<p align="justify">
A polymer (Greek poly-, "many" + -mer, "part") is a
substance or material consisting of very large molecules called
macromolecules, composed of many repeating subunits. Due to their
broad spectrum of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers
play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life. Polymers
range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural
biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to
biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and
synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules,
known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass, relative
to small molecule compounds, produces unique physical properties
including toughness, high elasticity, viscoelasticity, and a tendency
to form amorphous and semicrystalline structures rather than
crystals. 
<br><br>
The term "polymer" derives from the Greek word πολύς (polus, meaning
"many, much") and μέρος (meros, meaning "part"). The term was coined
in 1833 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius, though with a definition distinct
from the modern IUPAC definition. The modern concept of
polymers as covalently bonded macromolecular structures was proposed
in 1920 by Hermann Staudinger, who spent the next decade finding
experimental evidence for this hypothesis.
<br><br>
Polymers are studied in the fields of polymer science (which includes
polymer chemistry and polymer physics), biophysics and materials
science and engineering. Historically, products arising from the
linkage of repeating units by covalent chemical bonds have been the
primary focus of polymer science. An emerging important area now
focuses on supramolecular polymers formed by non-covalent
links. Polyisoprene of latex rubber is an example of a natural
polymer, and the polystyrene of styrofoam is an example of a synthetic
polymer. In biological contexts, essentially all biological
macromolecules—i.e., proteins (polyamides), nucleic acids
(polynucleotides), and polysaccharides—are purely polymeric, or are
composed in large part of polymeric components.
