<h1>Condensed Matter</h1>

<p align="justify">
Condensed matter physics is the field of physics that deals with the
macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of matter, especially
the solid and liquid phases which arise from electromagnetic forces
between atoms. More generally, the subject deals with condensed phases
of matter: systems of many constituents with strong interactions among
them. More exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase
exhibited by certain materials at extremely low cryogenic temperature,
the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on crystal
lattices of atoms, and the Boseâ€“Einstein condensate found in ultracold
atomic systems. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the
behavior of these phases by experiments to measure various material
properties, and by applying the physical laws of quantum mechanics,
electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, and other physics theories to
develop mathematical models. 
<br><br>
The diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes
condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary
physics: one third of all American physicists self-identify as
condensed matter physicists, and the Division of Condensed Matter
Physics is the largest division at the American Physical Society.
The field overlaps with chemistry, materials science, engineering and
nanotechnology, and relates closely to atomic physics and
biophysics. The theoretical physics of condensed matter shares
important concepts and methods with that of particle physics and
nuclear physics.
<br><br>
A variety of topics in physics such as crystallography, metallurgy,
elasticity, magnetism, etc., were treated as distinct areas until the
1940s, when they were grouped together as solid-state physics. Around
the 1960s, the study of physical properties of liquids was added to
this list, forming the basis for the more comprehensive specialty of
condensed matter physics. The Bell Telephone Laboratories was one
of the first institutes to conduct a research program in condensed
matter physics. According to founding director of the Max Planck
Institute for Solid State Research, physics professor Manuel Cardona,
it was Albert Einstein who created the modern field of condensed
matter physics starting with his seminal 1905 article on the
photoelectric effect and photoluminescence which opened the fields of
photoelectron spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy, and
later his 1907 article on the specific heat of solids which
introduced, for the first time, the effect of lattice vibrations on
the thermodynamic properties of crystals, in particular the specific
heat. Deputy Director of the Yale Quantum Institute A. Douglas
Stone makes a similar priority case for Einstein in his work on the
synthetic history of quantum mechanics.
