<h1>Field Theory</h1>

<p align="justify">
In physics, a field is a physical quantity, represented by a scalar,
vector, or tensor, that has a value for each point in space and
time. For example, on a weather map, the surface temperature
is described by assigning a number to each point on the map; the
temperature can be considered at a certain point in time or over some
interval of time, to study the dynamics of temperature change. A
surface wind map, assigning an arrow to each point on a map that
describes the wind speed and direction at that point, is an example of
a vector field, i.e. a 1-dimensional (rank-1) tensor field. Field
theories, mathematical descriptions of how field values change in
space and time, are ubiquitous in physics. For instance, the electric
field is another rank-1 tensor field, while electrodynamics can be
formulated in terms of two interacting vector fields at each point in
spacetime, or as a single-rank 2-tensor field.
<br><br>
In the modern framework of the quantum theory of fields, even without
referring to a test particle, a field occupies space, contains energy,
and its presence precludes a classical "true vacuum". This has led
physicists to consider electromagnetic fields to be a physical entity,
making the field concept a supporting paradigm of the edifice of
modern physics. "The fact that the electromagnetic field can possess
momentum and energy makes it very real ... a particle makes a field,
and a field acts on another particle, and the field has such familiar
properties as energy content and momentum, just as particles can
have." In practice, the strength of most fields diminishes with
distance, eventually becoming undetectable. For instance the strength
of many relevant classical fields, such as the gravitational field in
Newton's theory of gravity or the electrostatic field in classical
electromagnetism, is inversely proportional to the square of the
distance from the source (i.e., they follow Gauss's law). 
<br><br>
A field can be classified as a scalar field, a vector field, a spinor
field or a tensor field according to whether the represented physical
quantity is a scalar, a vector, a spinor, or a tensor, respectively. A
field has a consistent tensorial character wherever it is defined:
i.e. a field cannot be a scalar field somewhere and a vector field
somewhere else. For example, the Newtonian gravitational field is a
vector field: specifying its value at a point in spacetime requires
three numbers, the components of the gravitational field vector at
that point. Moreover, within each category (scalar, vector, tensor), a
field can be either a classical field or a quantum field, depending on
whether it is characterized by numbers or quantum operators
respectively. In this theory an equivalent representation of field is
a field particle, for instance a boson.
