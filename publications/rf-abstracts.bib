  year     = {2024},
  abstract = {The number zero is happily   used by mathematics, but not physics for various reasons.  It should  be incorrect to say that  $\phi(x)= 0=\gamma(x)$, when there are two, different, physical meanings, such as fields for two very different kinds of particles, etc. That could lead to some kind  of confusion in    physics. In that case, it could even be  necessary to {\bf reject} using the zero number  in certain  expressions, and instead, at least try to  `go around them'. 

Do not forget that the number zero was {\it banned} for 1,500  years, long, long ago!},

  abstract = {Standard quantization using, for example, path integration of field theory models, 
includes paths of momentum and field reach infinity in the Hamiltonian density, 
while the Hamiltonian itself remains finite. That fact causes considerable 
difficulties. In this paper, we represent $\pi(x)$ by $k(x)/\phi(x)$. To insure 
proper values for $\pi(x)$ it is necessary to restrict $0<|\phi(x)|<\infty$ as well 
as $0\leq|k(x)|<\infty$. Indeed that leads to Hamiltonian densities in which 
$\phi(x)^p$, where $p$ can be even integers between $4$ and $\infty$. This leads 
to a completely satisfactory quantization of field theories using situations that 
involve scaled behavior leading to an unexpected, $\hbar^2/\hat{\phi}(x)^2$ which 
arises only in the quantum aspects. Indeed, it is fair to claim that this symbol 
change leads to valid field theory quantizations.},

The particles can either be just bosons, when the configuration space is simply connected as for example for particles on a line. They can be bosons and fermions, when the configuration space is doubly connected as for example for particles in the tridimensional space or in a Riemannian surface of genus greater or equal to one (on the torus, etc.). They can be scalar anyons with arbitrary statistics, when the configuration space is infinitely connected as for particles on the plane or in the circle. They can be scalar anyons with fractional statistics, when the configuration space is the one of particles on a sphere. One can further have multi-components anyons with fractional statistics when the configuration space is doubly connected as for particles on a Riemannian surface of genus greater or equal to one.

  abstract = {As is well known, one-dimensional systems with interactions restricted to first nearest neighbors admit a full analytically exact statistical-mechanical solution. This is essentially due to the fact that the knowledge of the first nearest-neighbor probability distribution function, \(p_1(r)\), is enough to determine the structural and thermodynamic properties of the system. On the other hand, if the interaction between second nearest-neighbor particles is turned on, the analytically exact solution is lost. Not only the knowledge of \(p_1(r)\) is not sufficient anymore, but even its determination becomes a complex many-body problem. In this work we systematically explore different approximate solutions for one-dimensional second nearest-neighbor fluid models. We apply those approximations to the square-well and the attractive two-step pair potentials and compare them with Monte Carlo simulations, finding an excellent agreement.},

  abstract = {We consider an ionic fluid made with two species of mobile particles carrying either a positive or a negative charge. We derive a sum rule for the fourth moment of equilibrium charge correlations. Our method relies on the study of the system response to the potential created by a weak external charge distribution with slow spatial variations. The induced particle densities, and the resulting induced charge density, are then computed within density functional theory, where the free energy is expanded in powers of the density gradients. The comparison with the predictions of linear response theory provides a thermodynamical expression for the fourth moment of charge correlations, which involves the isothermal compressibility as well as suitably defined partial compressibilities. The familiar Stillinger-Lovett condition is also recovered as a by-product of our method, suggesting that the fourth moment sum rule should hold in any conducting phase. This is explicitly checked in the low density regime, within the Abe-Meeron diagrammatical expansions. Beyond its own interest, the fourth-moment sum rule should be useful for both analyzing and understanding recently observed behaviours near the ionic critical point.},

  abstract = {A general class of nonadditive sticky-hard-sphere binary mixtures, where small and large spheres represent the solvent and the solute, respectively, is introduced. The solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions are of hard-sphere type, while the solute-solvent interactions are of sticky-hard-sphere type with tunable degrees of size nonadditivity and stickiness. Two particular and complementary limits are studied using analytical and semi-analytical tools. The first case is characterized by zero nonadditivity, lending itself to a Percus-Yevick approximate solution from which the impact of stickiness on the spinodal curves and on the eff ective solute-solute potential is analyzed. In the opposite nonadditive case, the solvent-solvent diameter is zero and the model can then be reckoned as an extension of the well-known Asakura-Oosawa model with additional sticky solute-solvent interaction. This latter model has the property that its exact eff ective one-component problem involves only solute-solute pair potentials for size ratios such that a solvent particle fits inside the interstitial region of three touching solutes. In particular, we explicitly identify the three competing physical mechanisms (depletion, pulling, and bridging) giving rise to the eff ective interaction. Some remarks on the phase diagram of these two complementary models are also addressed through the use of the Noro-Frenkel criterion and a first-order perturbation analysis. Our findings suggest reentrance of the fluid-fluid instability as solvent density (in the first model) or adhesion (in the second model) is varied. Some perspectives in terms of the interpretation of recent experimental studies of microgels adsorbed onto large polystyrene particles are discussed.},

The analytical approach hinges on a mapping of the above Janus fluid onto a binary mixture interacting via a "quasi" isotropic potential. The anisotropic nature of the original Kern-Frenkel potential is reflected by the asymmetry in the interactions occurring between the unlike components of the mixture. A rational-function approximation extending the corresponding symmetric case is obtained in the sticky limit, where the square-well becomes infinitely narrow and deep, and allows a fully analytical approach. Notwithstanding the rather drastic approximations in the analytical theory, this is shown to provide a rather precise estimate of the structural and thermodynamical properties of the original Janus fluid.},

The Green's function equation necessary to determine the n-particle truncated correlation functions is explicitly found. In both cases this proves too complicated to be solved analytically. Therefore we present a method of solution reducing the problem to finding the two linearly independent solutions of a linear homogeneous second order ordinary differential equation with polynomial coefficients of high degrees. In the flat limit one recovers the solution for the structure of the TCP in a plane in the first case but the collapse of opposite charges at the horizon means that the structure of the plasma is physically not well defined in the second case.},

The approximation hinges on a separation between the intra- and inter-cluster contribution to thermodynamics, where only the former is explicitly computed by Monte Carlo simulations. Two level of a simple liquid theory approximations are exploited for the description of the latter.

  abstract = {The one-dimensional penetrable-square-well fluid is studied using both analytical tools and specialized Monte Carlo simulations. The model consists of a penetrable core characterized by a finite repulsive energy combined with a short-range attractive well. This is a many-body one-dimensional problem, lacking an exact analytical solution, for which the usual van Hove theorem on the absence of phase transition does not apply. We determine a high-penetrability approximation complementing a similar low-penetrability approximation presented in previous work. This is shown to be equivalent to the usual Debye-H\"uckel theory for simple charged fluids for which the virial and energy routes are identical. The internal thermodynamic consistency with the compressibility route and the validity of the approximation in describing the radial distribution function is assessed by a comparison against numerical simulations. The Fisher-Widom line separating the oscillatory and monotonic large-distance behaviors of the radial  distribution function is computed within the high-penetrability approximation and compared with the opposite regime, thus providing a strong indication of the location of the line in all possible regimes. The high-penetrability approximation predicts the existence of a critical point and a spinodal line, but this occurs outside the applicability domain of the theory. We investigate the possibility of a fluid-fluid transition by the Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo techniques, not finding any evidence of such a transition. Additional analytical arguments are given to support this claim. Finally, we find a clustering transition when Ruelleâ€™s stability criterion is not fulfilled. The consequences of these findings on the three-dimensional phase diagrams are also discussed.},

We also provide very accurate expressions which reproduce K as well as some parameters, $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$, of the required Baxter factor correlation functions with a relative error smaller than 1\%. We give a physical interpretation of the effects of the anisotropic adhesion on the $g(1,2)$ .

  abstract = {We discuss phase coexistence of polydisperse colloidal suspensions in the presence of adhesion forces. The combined effect of polydispersity and Baxter's sticky-hard-sphere (SHS) potential, describing hard spheres interacting via strong and very short-ranged attractive forces, give rise, within the Percus-Yevick (PY) approximation, to a system of coupled quadratic equations which, in general, cannot be solved either analytically or numerically. We review and compare two recent alternative proposals, which we have attempted to by-pass this difficulty. In the first one, truncating the density expansion of the direct correlation functions, we have considered approximations simpler than the PY one. These $C_{n}$ approximations can be systematically improved. We have been able to provide a complete analytical description of polydisperse SHS fluids by using the simplest two orders $C_{0}$ and $C_{1}$, respectively. Such a simplification comes at the price of a lower accuracy in the phase diagram, but has the advantage of providing an analytical description of various new phenomena associated with the onset of polydispersity in phase equilibria (e.g. fractionation). The second approach is based on a perturbative expansion of the polydisperse PY solution around its monodisperse counterpart. This approach provides a sound approximation to the real phase behavior, at the cost of considering only weak polydispersity. Although a final seattlement on the soundness of the latter method would require numerical simulations for the polydisperse Baxter model, we argue that this approach is expected to keep correctly into account the effects of polydispersity, at least qualitatively.},

S. Chen and F. Forstmann [J. Chem. Phys. 97, 3696 (1992)]. This scheme hinges on a diagonalization of the matrix of second functional derivatives of the grand canonical potential with respect to the particle density fluctuations. The zeroes of the smallest eigenvalue and the direction of the relative eigenvector characterize the instability uniquely. We explicitly compute three different classes of examples. For a symmetrical binary mixture, analytical calculations, both for mMSA and for PY, predict that when the strength of adhesiveness between like particles is smaller than the one between unlike particles, only a pure condensation spinodal exists; in the opposite regime, a pure demixing spinodal appears at high densities. We then compare the mMSA and PY results for a mixture where like particles interact as hard spheres (HS) and unlike particles as SHS, and for a mixture of HS in a SHS fluid. In these cases, even though the mMSA and PY spinodals are quantitatively and qualitatively very different from each other, we prove that they have the same kind of instabilities. Finally, we study the mMSA solution for five different mixtures obtained by setting the stickiness parameters equal to five different functions of the hard sphere diameters. We find that four of the five mixtures exhibit very different type of instabilities. Our results are expected to provide a further step toward a more thoughtful application of SHS models to colloidal fluids.},

Since no phase transition is allowed in such 1D system our analysis shows that the proposed one phase criterion. at least in this case, fails.

We propose a new approach for deriving closures automatically satisfying such characteristics. Results from a first exploration of this program are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {The classical (i.e., non-quantum) equilibrium statistical mechanics of a two-dimensional one-component plasma (a system of charged point-particles embedded in a neutralizing background) living on a pseudosphere (an infinite surface of constant negative curvature) is considered. In the case of a flat space, it is known that, for a one-component plasma, there are several reasonable definitions of the pressure, and that some of them are not equivalent to each other. In the present paper, this problem is revisited in the case of a pseudosphere. General relations between the different pressures are given. At one special temperature, the model is exactly solvable in the grand canonical ensemble. The grand potential and the one-body density are calculated in a disk, and the thermodynamic limit is investigated. The general relations between the different pressures are checked on the solvable model.},

  abstract = {The interacting reference response function $\Chi_I^{[3]}(k)$ of three-dimensional jellium ink space was defined by Niklasson in terms of the momentum distribution of the interacting electron assembly. Here the Fourier transform $F_I^{[d]}(r)$ of $\Chi_I^{[d]}(k)$ is studied for the jellium model with $e^2/r$ interactions in dimensionality $d=1,2$ and 3, in an extension of recent work by Holas, March and Tosi for the case $d=3$. The small-$r$ and large-$r$ forms of $F_I^{[d]}(r)$ are explicitly evaluated from the analytic behaviour of the momentum distribution $n_d(p)$. In the appendix, a model of $n_d(p)$ is constructed which interpolates between these limits.},

  abstract = {The asymptotic behaviours of particle correlation functions and the related sum rules are discussed for a layered classical plasma with $e^2/r$ interactions in the fluid state, in dependence on the number of layers. These properties derive from consistency conditions imposed by screening on the hierarchical equations, as already treated by A. Alastuey and P. A. Martin (J. Stat. Phys.,39, 405 (1985)) for various Coulomb fluids. The main results concern i) the type of clustering of correlations needed for the validity of multipolar sum rules at various orders, ii) the proof that the pair correlation function in a finite multilayer may carry an electric dipole moment and the calculation of its partioning among the layers, and iii) the dimensionality crossover in an infinitely extended or periodically repeated multiplayer with varying interlayer spacing and wave vector.},
